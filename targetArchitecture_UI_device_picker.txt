let's proceed with UI device picker

Great choice.
A UI device picker is exactly the right next step — it removes heuristics and makes your router explicit, debuggable, and user-friendly.

Below is a clean, incremental plan that fits your current architecture and does not break anything that already works.

🎯 Goal

Let the user select:

MIDI INPUT device (keyboard, controller)
MIDI THRU / OUTPUT device (Fluidsynth, synth app)

At runtime, without restarting the app.

1️⃣ High-level design (simple & robust)

We add:

MainActivity
 ├── Two Spinners (Input / Thru)
 ├── MidiController
 │    ├── Enumerate devices
 │    ├── Open selected INPUT
 │    └── Open selected THRU
 └── MidiProcessor (unchanged)


Key rule:
UI decides which devices → controller only opens what it’s told.
